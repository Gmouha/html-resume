    <h1 >About Me</h1>
    <p style="margin: center">Hello, I'm Mouhamed, a passionate Software Engineer Apprentice who's currently working with the Salesforce platform, with the desire to become a Salesforce Administrator. 
    I really enjoy solving problems, hence why I'm so interested in becoming an engineeer.
    I'm working really hard towards my goal, which is to become a senior in both software development and salesforce administrator. 
    Since programming is mentally challenging, i like to keep my body active as well. Outside of work, I work out and play sports regularly, so I that I have an excuse to get out of my chair and sweat a bit.  </p>

    <h1>Education</h1>
    <p>I have attended nursery and primary schoold in Italy, but then i had to relocate at the age of 12. 
    I later attended high school and college in the UK. I have enjoyed both experiences 
    however primary and highschool have been the best moments of my childhood.</p>
    <hr>
    <h1>Work experience</h1>
    <p>Before diving into the world of technology, i previously worked many warehouses jobs and I'm glad I did 
    because it taught me some valuable skills. These are skills that have helped me in my journey as a software engineer;
    I learned to pay attention to details and be capable to manage my time. This is because before clocking out, in every shift
    I had a target that I had to meet. Furthermore, being a problem solver is nothing new to me because a warehouse is a really fast paced environment, and anything can happen at anytime.</p>
    <hr>
    <h1>Skills</h1>
    <div class="skills">
    <p>As i mentioned earlier, thanks to my previous work experiences I've managed to pick up some valuable soft skills. 
    These skills are: communication, team player, being independent, self starter, problem solver, positive attitude.

    
    Since I'm currently a software engineer apprentice, these are the hard skills I'm working: html, css, JavaScript, ReactJs, NodeJs, Apex, VisualForce.
